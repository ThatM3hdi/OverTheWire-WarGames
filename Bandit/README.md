# OverTheWire Bandit Write-ups

Bandit is a beginner-friendly wargame focused on Linux commands, file manipulation, networking, and basic security concepts. Each level teaches a new skill by finding the password for the next level.

## Overview
- **Levels:** 0 to 33 (34 levels total)
- **Goal:** Learn basics like `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `ssh`, `netcat`, SSL/TLS, and more.
- **My Notes:** I started writing detailed write-ups from Level 10 → Level 11 onward (earlier levels are very basic).

## Tips
- Always take notes locally – passwords change occasionally!
- Use SSH on port 2220: `ssh banditX@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
- If stuck, read the level hints or man pages.
