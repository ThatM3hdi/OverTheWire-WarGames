# OverTheWire WarGames Write-ups

This repository contains my personal write-ups and notes for OverTheWire wargames. I'm solving these challenges to strengthen my Linux, networking and cybersecurity skills - starting with Bandit as beginner-friendly introduction to command-line and basic exploitation.

## Games Included
- [Bandit](./Bandit) - linux basics and introductory challanges.

(Will add more games like Natas, Leviathan, etc., as I progress.)

## Resources
- Official site: [OverTheWire-WarGames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

- My progress: Started January 2026 – aiming to complete Bandit and move to advanced games.
